# A-B-TEST


A website that started using "average bidding" developed by Facebook as an alternative to the current bidding type "maximum bidding", wants to do an A/B test to see if this method yields more conversions.
This website randomly divides its target audience into two equally sized groups as Control and Test groups. A Facebook ad campaign with "maximum bidding" is served to the "Control Group" and another campaign with "average bidding" is served to the "Test Group".

The problem we focus on is whether the difference between the means of purchase in the control and test groups is statistically significant.
For this analysis, we should use the independent sample t-test, which we are familiar with from the statistical literature.
